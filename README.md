Where Student Meets Teacher
Knowledge Base - an online platform for universities/colleges, students and teachers to collaborate online, also a platform for Universities to Come Online. KBase makes interactions between/among knowledge seekers and knowledge providers smoother, faster, and a lot more fun!

Our education system is rooted on student-teacher interactions since time immemorial. However, class room interactions alone are not sufficient to make the student ready to face the tight schedules and intensive academic effort required by courses offered by modern day universities.  Here KBase steps in to make interactions between/among students/teachers smoother and more efficient. 
Using KBase, students can enroll in various courses offered by their universities and view lectures and presentations corresponding to the enrolled courses. The enrollment will have to be approved by a registered tutor and the course material (lecture videos, presentations and docs) and schedule will be managed by the respective tutors.
